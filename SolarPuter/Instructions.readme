Put a configuration like the following one into the custom data of a programmable block, which should act as a SolarPuter:

[SolarPuterConfiguration]
SolarArrays=Solar 1;Solar 2;Solar 3
DisplayGroup=Solar Displays

The list in 'SolarArrays' can be extended by adding groups of solar arrays seperated by semi-colons.

Driving rotors are marked with the tag [D].
Bearing rotors are marked with the tag [B].

The display group is optional.
